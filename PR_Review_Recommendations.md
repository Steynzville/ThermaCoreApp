*   **Timeliness:** Review PRs promptly to avoid bottlenecks. Aim for a 24-hour turnaround where possible.

## Code Review Specifics

*   **Readability:** Check for clear variable names, well-structured code, and appropriate comments, adhering to ThermaCoreApp's coding style.

*   **Performance:** Identify any potential performance bottlenecks or inefficient algorithms relevant to ThermaCoreApp's operational demands.
*   **Security:** Look for common security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, insecure deserialization) specifically in the context of ThermaCoreApp's data handling.
*   **Testing:** Ensure adequate test coverage for new or modified code. Verify existing tests still pass and consider adding new tests for critical paths.
*   **Error Handling:** Check for robust error handling mechanisms that align with ThermaCoreApp's error reporting standards.

*   **Unit Tests:** Ensure new code has corresponding unit tests and that existing tests are updated if functionality changes, using ThermaCoreApp's testing framework.
*   **Integration Tests:** Where applicable, check for integration tests that cover the interaction between different components of ThermaCoreApp.

## Best Practices for Reviewers

*   **Understand the Context:** Before diving into the code, understand the purpose of the PR and the problem it aims to solve within ThermaCoreApp.
*   **Ask Questions:** If something is unclear, ask the author for clarification rather than making assumptions.
*   **Suggest, Don't Demand:** Phrase suggestions as questions or recommendations, e.g., Have you considered X? or Perhaps Y would be clearer here.
*   **Approve When Ready:** Only approve a PR when you are confident in its quality and correctness for ThermaCoreApp.
*   **Address All Comments:** Ensure all comments are addressed by the author before final approval.

## Best Practices for Authors

*   **Self-Review:** Before submitting, review your own code. This often catches simple mistakes.
*   **Clear Description:** Provide a clear and concise PR description, explaining what the PR does, why it's needed, and how to test it within the ThermaCoreApp context.
*   **Small, Focused PRs:** Keep PRs small and focused on a single logical change to make them easier to review.
*   **Respond to Feedback:** Address all review comments promptly and respectfully. If you disagree, explain your reasoning.
*   **Update Documentation:** Update any relevant documentation alongside code changes.

By following these recommendations, we aim to improve the quality, efficiency, and collaborative nature of our PR review process for **ThermaCoreApp**.
