## Verification Results

### ‚úÖ Verified Accurate

1. **Project Structure**:
   - Frontend source code location (`src/`) - Confirmed
   - Backend structure (`backend/app/`) - Confirmed
   - Test locations (`src/tests/`, `backend/app/tests/`) - Confirmed

2. **Dependencies**:
   - Package manager (`pnpm`) - Confirmed throughout
   - Python testing framework (`pytest`) - Confirmed in requirements.txt
   - Build tools and scripts - Confirmed in package.json

3. **Directory References**:
   - `src/components/` - Confirmed
   - `src/services/` - Confirmed
   - `src/utils/` - Confirmed (not just `src/lib/`)
   - `backend/app/models/` - Confirmed
   - `backend/app/routes/` - Confirmed

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Noted for Awareness
