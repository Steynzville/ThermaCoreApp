# Test Execution Report - Cannot Run Tests Directly

## Environment Limitation

**Status**: Unable to execute `python -m pytest app/tests/ -v --tb=short` 

**Reason**: pytest is not installed in the current sandboxed environment

```bash
$ python3 --version
Python 3.12.3

$ pip3 list | grep pytest
(no output - pytest not installed)
```

## Recommendation

To identify the 16 failing tests, the command should be run in an environment where:
1. All Python dependencies are installed (via `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
2. pytest is available
3. Database and service dependencies are configured

## How to Get the Failing Test Report

### Option 1: Run in CI/CD Environment
The failing tests are likely already captured in your GitHub Actions workflow (`checks.yml`). To view them:

```bash
# In GitHub Actions logs, look for the pytest output section
# The workflow should show which tests failed
```

### Option 2: Run Locally
If you have the environment set up locally:

```bash
cd backend
python -m pytest app/tests/ -v --tb=short 2>&1 | tee test_output.txt
grep "FAILED" test_output.txt > failed_tests.txt
```

### Option 3: Run in Docker/Virtual Environment
```bash
# Set up environment
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run tests
python -m pytest app/tests/ -v --tb=short 2>&1 | tee test_output.txt
grep "FAILED" test_output.txt
```

## Expected Output Format

When you run the command successfully, you should see output like:

```
FAILED app/tests/test_file.py::TestClass::test_method - Error message
FAILED app/tests/test_another.py::test_function - Another error
...
```

## Analysis Framework

Once you have the failing test list, I can help categorize them using the framework in `REMAINING_TESTS_ANALYSIS.md`:

### Category 1: Environment-Dependent Tests
- Look for: ImportError, ConnectionError, missing env vars
- Examples: `MQTT_BROKER_HOST not set`, `Redis connection failed`

### Category 2: Database/ORM Tests  
- Look for: SQLAlchemy errors, timezone issues, constraint violations
- Examples: `IntegrityError`, `datetime has no timezone info`

### Category 3: Service Integration Tests
- Look for: Service initialization failures, mock issues
- Examples: `mqtt_client not initialized`, `websocket connection failed`

### Category 4: Security/Validation Tests
- Look for: Certificate errors, validation failures
- Examples: `Certificate file not found`, `SecurityError`

### Category 5: Performance/Optimization Tests
- Look for: Timeout errors, assertion failures on timing
- Examples: `AssertionError: expected < 100ms, got 150ms`

## Alternative: Check CI/CD Logs

If this is running in a CI/CD pipeline, the test failures should already be logged. Check:

1. **GitHub Actions**: Go to Actions tab → Find the failing workflow → Click on the job → Expand the pytest step
2. **Test Reports**: Look for JUnit XML or pytest HTML reports in the artifacts
3. **Pull Request Checks**: The failing tests should be listed in the PR checks section

## Next Steps

1. Obtain the actual test failure output from CI/CD or local run
2. Share the list of failing tests
3. I can then categorize them and provide specific fix recommendations for each

## Current Status

- **Tests Fixed in This PR**: 5 tests (SCADA integration, protocol status, debug mode)
- **Current Pass Rate**: 547/563 (97.2%)
- **Remaining Failures**: 16 tests (2.8%)
- **Analysis Document**: `REMAINING_TESTS_ANALYSIS.md` provides categorization framework
