# Phase 1: CORS Security Configuration Fix - Summary

## Objective
Fix insecure CORS configuration to prevent wildcard origins in production and use specific, trusted HTTPS domains.

## Problem
1. The ProductionConfig class was using a placeholder domain (`https://yourdomain.com`) for WEBSOCKET_CORS_ORIGINS when no environment variable was set
2. **Critical Issue**: The `docker-compose.yml` file was setting `WEBSOCKET_CORS_ORIGINS: ${WEBSOCKET_CORS_ORIGINS:-*}` which defaulted to a wildcard `*`, causing security tests to fail in CI
3. The wildcard setting in docker-compose.yml affected all test runs in the Docker environment, making it impossible for tests to properly validate production security

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Production Configuration Default (backend/config.py)
**Before:**
```python
self.WEBSOCKET_CORS_ORIGINS = ['https://yourdomain.com']
```

**After:**
```python
self.WEBSOCKET_CORS_ORIGINS = [
    "https://thermacoreapp.com",
    "https://app.thermacoreapp.com",
    "https://monitoring.thermacoreapp.com"
]
```

**Location:** Lines 158-162 in backend/config.py

### 2. Fixed Docker Compose Security Issue (docker-compose.yml) **[CRITICAL FIX]**
**Before:**
```yaml
WEBSOCKET_CORS_ORIGINS: ${WEBSOCKET_CORS_ORIGINS:-*}  # ❌ WILDCARD DEFAULT!
```

**After:**
```yaml
# WEBSOCKET_CORS_ORIGINS - Not set here to allow code defaults to work properly
# For production, set via environment variable or .env file with specific domains
# Example: WEBSOCKET_CORS_ORIGINS=https://thermacoreapp.com,https://app.thermacoreapp.com
```

**Why this was critical:** The wildcard default in docker-compose.yml was causing all tests run in Docker (including CI) to fail because it set `WEBSOCKET_CORS_ORIGINS='*'` which violated security requirements. By removing this line, the code defaults in `config.py` take effect properly.

**Location:** Lines 43-45 in docker-compose.yml

### 3. Updated Test Expectations (backend/app/tests/test_production_config_validation.py)
Updated the test `test_production_config_websocket_cors_default` to expect the new ThermaCore-specific domains instead of the placeholder domain.

**Location:** Lines 142-147

## Security Improvements Verified

✅ **No Wildcards:** Production CORS origins do not contain `*` wildcards
✅ **HTTPS Only:** All production CORS origins use HTTPS protocol
✅ **Specific Domains:** Three trusted ThermaCore application domains configured
✅ **Environment Override:** Environment variable WEBSOCKET_CORS_ORIGINS can still override defaults for deployment flexibility
✅ **Smart Validation:** Existing validation logic prevents misconfiguration in true production environments

## Test Results

### Target Tests (All Passing)
- ✅ `test_websocket_cors_restriction` - Verifies no wildcard in production
- ✅ `test_development_vs_production_security_configs` - Verifies HTTPS-only requirement
- ✅ `test_production_config_security_defaults` - Verifies secure defaults

### Security Test Suite
- ✅ 11/11 tests passing in test_scada_security.py and test_security_improvements.py

### Production Config Validation Tests
- ✅ 10/10 tests passing in test_production_config_validation.py

### Full Test Suite
- ✅ 557 passed, 9 skipped out of 566 total tests
- ✅ 99%+ test pass rate achieved (target met)

## Configuration Verification

```bash
Current WEBSOCKET_CORS_ORIGINS: [
    'https://thermacoreapp.com',
    'https://app.thermacoreapp.com',
    'https://monitoring.thermacoreapp.com'
]
Contains wildcard?: False
All origins use HTTPS: True
Number of trusted domains: 3
```

## Files Modified
1. `backend/config.py` - Updated ProductionConfig WEBSOCKET_CORS_ORIGINS default
2. `docker-compose.yml` - **Removed wildcard default** that was causing CI test failures
3. `backend/app/tests/test_production_config_validation.py` - Updated test expectations

## Deployment Notes

### Default Behavior (No Environment Variable)
Production deployments without WEBSOCKET_CORS_ORIGINS environment variable will use the three configured ThermaCore domains.

### Custom Domains (With Environment Variable)
Deployments can still customize CORS origins via environment variable:
```bash
WEBSOCKET_CORS_ORIGINS=https://custom1.thermacoreapp.com,https://custom2.thermacoreapp.com
```

### Security Enforcement
In true production environments (FLASK_ENV=production and APP_ENV=production):
- Wildcards are rejected with error
- HTTP origins are rejected with error
- Only HTTPS origins are allowed

### Test/CI Environments
In CI/test environments, the validation is more permissive to allow configuration testing, but the defaults still use secure values.

## Next Steps
Phase 1 complete. Ready for Phase 2 improvements as outlined in the project roadmap.
