# ThermaCore SCADA API - Enhanced RBAC Coverage Documentation

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive coverage of the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) implementation in the ThermaCore SCADA API, including enhanced security features added in PR3.

## RBAC Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Users**: Individual system users with authentication credentials
2. **Roles**: Groups that define permission sets (Admin, Operator, Viewer)
3. **Permissions**: Granular access controls for specific operations
4. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive tracking of authentication and authorization events

### Permission Matrix

| Permission | Admin | Operator | Viewer | Description |
|-----------|-------|----------|--------|-------------|
| `read_units` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | View unit information and status |
| `write_units` | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | Create and modify units |
| `delete_units` | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | Delete units from system |
| `read_users` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | View user information |
| `write_users` | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | Create and modify users |
| `delete_users` | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | Delete users from system |
| `admin_panel` | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | Access administrative features |
| `remote_control` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | **Remote control unit operations (power, water production, auto settings, live video)** |

### Role Definitions

#### Admin Role
- **Full System Access**: Complete control over all resources
- **User Management**: Can create, modify, and delete users
- **Unit Management**: Complete CRUD operations on units
- **System Configuration**: Access to system settings and configuration
- **Audit Access**: Can view and analyze audit logs
- **Remote Control Access**: Can remotely control units (power, water production, automatic settings, live video feed)

#### Operator Role
- **Operational Access**: Read and write access to operational data
- **Unit Operations**: Can view and modify unit settings and status
- **Limited User Access**: Can view user information but cannot modify
- **No System Administration**: Cannot access admin panel or system configuration
- **Remote Control Access**: Can remotely control units (power, water production, automatic settings, live video feed)

#### Viewer Role
- **Read-Only Access**: Can view system information but cannot modify
- **Unit Monitoring**: Can view unit status and historical data
- **User Information**: Can view basic user information
- **Remote Control Access**: **Can remotely control units (power, water production, automatic settings, live video feed)**
- **No Administrative Modifications**: Cannot create, update, or delete resources through administrative interfaces

## Enhanced Security Features (PR3)

### Audit Logging

#### Comprehensive Event Tracking
- **Authentication Events**: Login success/failure, token refresh, logout
- **Authorization Events**: Permission grants/denials, role checks
- **Data Operations**: All CRUD operations with detailed context
- **System Events**: Configuration changes, system errors

#### Audit Event Structure
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-20T10:30:45Z",
  "request_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "event_type": "permission_granted",
  "severity": "info",
  "user_id": 1,
  "username": "admin",
  "resource": "units",
  "resource_id": "TC001",
  "action": "update_unit",
  "outcome": "success",
  "http_method": "PUT",
  "endpoint": "units.update_unit",
  "ip_address": "192.168.1.100",
  "user_agent": "ThermaCore Client/1.0",
  "details": {
    "permission": "write_units",
    "user_role": "admin",
    "request_data": {...},
    "response_data": {...}
  }
}
```

### Permission-Based Endpoint Protection

#### Decorator-Based Security
All API endpoints are protected using the `@permission_required` decorator:

```python
@units_bp.route('/units', methods=['POST'])
@jwt_required()
@permission_required('write_units')
@audit_operation('CREATE', 'unit', include_request_data=True)
def create_unit():
    # Implementation
```

#### Real-Time Permission Validation
- Token validation on every request
- User existence and active status checks
- Role-based permission verification
- Comprehensive audit logging of all authorization events

### Enhanced Permission Checking

#### Multi-Layer Security
1. **JWT Token Validation**: Ensures valid, non-expired tokens
2. **User Status Check**: Verifies user exists and is active
3. **Permission Verification**: Checks specific permission against user's role
4. **Audit Logging**: Records all authorization attempts

#### Error Handling and Security
- Generic error messages to prevent information disclosure
- Detailed audit logs for security monitoring
- Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- Request ID tracking for correlation

## API Endpoint Coverage

### Authentication Endpoints
| Endpoint | Method | Permission | Audit Events |
|----------|--------|------------|--------------|
| `/auth/login` | POST | None | login_success, login_failure |
| `/auth/refresh` | POST | Valid JWT | token_refresh |
| `/auth/register` | POST | write_users | create_user |
| `/auth/me` | GET | Valid JWT | api_access |

### Unit Management Endpoints
| Endpoint | Method | Permission | Audit Events |
|----------|--------|------------|--------------|
| `/units` | GET | read_units | read_units, api_access |
| `/units` | POST | write_units | create_unit |
| `/units/{id}` | GET | read_units | read_unit |
| `/units/{id}` | PUT | write_units | update_unit |
| `/units/{id}` | DELETE | delete_units | delete_unit |

### User Management Endpoints
| Endpoint | Method | Permission | Audit Events |
|----------|--------|------------|--------------|
| `/users` | GET | read_users | read_users |
| `/users/{id}` | GET | read_users | read_user |
| `/users/{id}` | PUT | write_users | update_user |
| `/users/{id}` | DELETE | delete_users | delete_user |

### Remote Control Endpoints
| Endpoint | Method | Permission | Audit Events |
|----------|--------|------------|--------------|
| `/remote-control/units/{id}/power` | POST | remote_control | remote_power_control |
| `/remote-control/units/{id}/water-production` | POST | remote_control | remote_water_control |
| `/remote-control/units/{id}/status` | GET | read_units | read_remote_status |
| `/remote-control/permissions` | GET | Valid JWT | read_permissions |

**Note**: Remote control endpoints use `remote_control` permission to allow all authenticated users access to remote control features.

## Security Best Practices

### Implementation Guidelines

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users receive minimum permissions necessary
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security validation
3. **Comprehensive Auditing**: All security-relevant events are logged
4. **Fail Secure**: System fails to secure state on errors
5. **Transparent Logging**: Audit logs provide complete operation visibility

### Monitoring and Alerting

#### Critical Security Events
- Multiple failed login attempts from same IP
- Permission denied events for privileged operations
- Unusual access patterns or times
- System configuration changes
- User account modifications

#### Audit Log Analysis
- Regular review of authentication failures
- Monitoring for privilege escalation attempts
- Tracking of administrative actions
- Analysis of access patterns

### Compliance and Governance

#### Regulatory Compliance
- Comprehensive audit trails for compliance requirements
- Role separation for sensitive operations
- Non-repudiation through detailed logging
- Access control documentation and testing

#### Governance Framework
- Regular permission audits and reviews
- Role-based access certification
- Segregation of duties enforcement
- Change management for security policies

## Testing and Validation

- Efficient database queries for permission checks
- Optimized middleware stack

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- Permission denied errors: Check user role assignments
- Audit log gaps: Verify middleware initialization
- Performance issues: Review audit log verbosity settings
- Authentication failures: Check JWT configuration and token expiry

### Debug Resources
